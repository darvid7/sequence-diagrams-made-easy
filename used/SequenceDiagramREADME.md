# Sequence Diagram ReadMe

For sequence diagrams we have shown the normal flow for each use case.

## Use cases:


### 1. ServerStart

An admin starts the backend server running `npm run backend-start`.

We show this as a use case as it gives a good high level over view of the entire system including the loop to get weather data every 5 minutes.
